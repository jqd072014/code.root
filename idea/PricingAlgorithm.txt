Two major features-- allow traders to compute the state of the market and control/publish curves for their prices.
===================
(1) computing a best-bid/best-offer for bonds based of (1) direct market prices, (2) swap market prices, and (3) basis/future prices.
(2) output a price of one bond relative to the price of another bond. Together, these features 


Computing “BestBidOffer”
=========================
The “BestBidOffer” price is merely the best bid and best offer from 3 other prices: “BestFromMarket”, “BestFromSwap” and “BestFromBasis”.

The “BestFromMarket” price is computed by taking the best bid and offer from all tradable prices on an Instrument.

The “BestFromSwap” price is computed by using swap prices and to derive a price for the off-the-run bond. If someone buys a swap,
 they buy the off-the-run at the swap price and sell the on-the-run at the lock price. If they do the swap trade and also purchase 
an on-the-run at the same time, they would end up with the just the off-the-run bond. Thus, using the swap price, lock price, 
and on-the-run price, we derive a price for just the off-the-run bond. The best-bid and best-offer for all swap trades is the
 “BestFromSwap” price.

The “BestFromBasis” price is similar to the “BestFromSwap” price, except for the basis trade. The basis trade is buying a bond and 
selling the future. Together with buying a future, this trade generates a price for the bond by itself.

Curves
======
The CurvePricer uses  “CurveSpread” to publish a price for one bond relative to the price of the other Bond. 

“Name” – the name used for the MktDefinition.
“BestBidOffer-<Name>” --The curve merged with the BestBidOffer
“Instrument” – the instrument to price
“Benchmark” – the instrument used to generate prices off of
“BenchmarkName” – the name used for the specific price on the Benchmark to use. E.g., “BestFromMarket”
“SpreadFromBenchmark” – usually, the spread in yield from the Benchmark price to the Instrument pric
“BidAskSpread” – the spread in price for the resulting bid and ask of the output price
